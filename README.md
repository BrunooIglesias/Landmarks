# Landmarks App - Swift Learning Journey

## Overview
This project is a learning exercise in Swift and SwiftUI, where I built a Landmarks app to explore various iOS development concepts and features. The app serves as a practical way to understand Swift programming, UI design, and iOS app architecture.

## Project Structure
The app follows a well-organized structure with separate directories for different components:

- **Views/**: Contains the UI components and screens
- **Model/**: Houses the data models and business logic
- **Assets.xcassets/**: Stores images and other media resources
- **Resources/**: Contains additional resources used in the app
- **Helper/**: Contains utility functions and helper classes
- **Categories/**: Manages different categories of landmarks
- **Profile/**: Handles user profile related functionality
- **Hikes/**: Contains hiking-related features
- **Badges/**: Manages achievement badges

## Key Features and Learning Points

### SwiftUI Framework
- Learned to build user interfaces using SwiftUI's declarative syntax
- Implemented state management using `@State` and `@Environment` property wrappers
- Created reusable view components
- Explored SwiftUI's layout system and view modifiers

### App Architecture
- Implemented the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern
- Used Swift's modern concurrency features
- Learned about Swift's type system and protocols
- Implemented proper data flow and state management

### UI/UX Design
- Created responsive layouts that work across different device sizes
- Implemented navigation patterns
- Used SwiftUI's built-in animations and transitions
- Designed custom UI components

### Data Management
- Worked with Swift's data structures
- Implemented data persistence
- Created models for landmarks and user data
- Managed state across different views

## Technical Stack
- **Swift**: The primary programming language
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface
- **Xcode**: The development environment
- **iOS SDK**: For accessing platform features

## Learning Outcomes
Through building this app, I gained practical experience in:
- Swift programming fundamentals
- iOS app architecture and design patterns
- UI/UX design principles
- State management in SwiftUI
- Debugging and testing iOS applications
- Working with Xcode and iOS development tools

## Future Improvements
Potential areas for future enhancement:
- Adding more interactive features
- Implementing user authentication
- Adding offline support
- Enhancing the UI with more animations
- Implementing more advanced data management features

## Getting Started
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
